    "Project_SuperClass": "I developed this <b>Gravity Manipulator</b> script in Unity to simulate both directional and spherical gravity across 2D and 3D environments. Designed for <b>reusability</b> and <b>flexibility</b>, it automatically configures colliders and supports dynamic gravitational fields with features like <b>falloff intensity</b>, <b>bidirectional pull</b>, and <b>rotational alignment</b>.<br><br> Built with extensibility in mind, it integrates seamlessly with gravity-aware components and is optimized for performance using <b>interval-based scanning</b> or <b>trigger-based detection</b>.",
